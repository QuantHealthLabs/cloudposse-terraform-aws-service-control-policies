Terraform module to provision Service Control Policies (SCP) for AWS Organizations, Organizational Units, and AWS accounts.


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

## Introduction

Service Control Policies are configured in YAML configuration files.

We maintain a comprehensive [catalog](catalog) of SCP configurations and welcome contributions via pull request!

The [example](examples/complete) in this module uses the catalog to provision the SCPs on AWS.

The policies in the `catalog/*-templates` files require parameters supplied via the `parameters` input
to [terraform-yaml-config](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-yaml-config).




## Usage

For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
(which tests and deploys the example on Datadog), see [test](test).


```hcl
  module "yaml_config" {
    source = "cloudposse/config/yaml"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"

    list_config_local_base_path = path.module
    list_config_paths           = ["catalog/*.yaml"]

    context = module.this.context
  }

  module "yaml_config_with_parameters" {
    source = "cloudposse/config/yaml"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"

    list_config_local_base_path = path.module
    list_config_paths           = ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-service-control-policies/0.12.0/catalog/s3-templates/DenyS3InNonSelectedRegion.yaml"]

    parameters = {
      "s3_regions_lockdown" = "us-*,eu-north-1"
      }

    context = module.this.context
  }

  data "aws_caller_identity" "this" {}

  module "service_control_policies" {
    source = "../../"

    service_control_policy_statements  = concat(module.yaml_config.list_configs, module.yaml_config_with_parameters.list_configs)
    service_control_policy_description = var.service_control_policy_description
    target_id                          = data.aws_caller_identity.this.account_id

    context = module.this.context
  }
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
