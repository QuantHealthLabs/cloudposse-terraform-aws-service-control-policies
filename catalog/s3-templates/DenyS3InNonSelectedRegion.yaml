#  - s3_regions_lockdown # Comma separated list of regions or region patterns in which to allow S3 bucket creation
#
# NOTE: "us-east-1" is the default region and cannot be specified explicitly.
#       Therefore, this policy always excludes "us-east-1" from the list of allowed regions,
#       because for us-east-1, s3:LocationConstraint is empty.
